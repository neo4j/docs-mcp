| Tool                 | ReadOnly | Purpose                                        | Notes
| `get-schema`         | Yes      | Introspect labels, relationship types, property keys | Provide valuable context to the client LLMs.
| `read-cypher`        | Yes      | Execute arbitrary Cypher (read mode)           | Rejects writes, schema/admin operations, and PROFILE queries.
| `write-cypher`       | No       | Execute arbitrary Cypher (write mode)          | Caution: LLM-generated queries can cause harm. Use only in development environments. Disabled if `NEO4J_READ_ONLY=true`.
| `list-gds-procedures` | Yes     | List GDS procedures available in the instance  | Help the client LLM to have better visibility on available GDS procedures.
|===

=== Readonly mode

Enable readonly mode by setting the `NEO4J_READ_ONLY` environment variable to `true`.
When enabled, write tools (such as `write-cypher`) are not exposed to clients.

== Examples for natural language prompts

Here are some example prompts you can try in Copilot or any other MCP client:

- "What does my Neo4j instance contain? List all node labels, relationship types, and property keys."
- "Find all Person nodes and their relationships in my Neo4j instance."
- "Create a new User node with a name 'John' in my Neo4j instance."

== Security considerations

- Use a restricted Neo4j user for exploration.
- Review the generated Cypher queries before executing them in production databases.
