| `get-schema` | Introspect labels, relationship types, property keys. | Read-only. Provide valuable context to the client LLMs.                                   
| `run-cypher` | Execute arbitrary Cypher (read/write).                | **Caution:** LLM-generated queries can cause harm. Use only in development environments.

## Examples for natural language prompts

Here are some example prompts you can try in Copilot or any other MCP client:

- "What does my Neo4j instance contain? List all node labels, relationship types, and property keys."
- "Find all Person nodes and their relationships in my Neo4j instance."
- "Create a new User node with a name 'John' in my Neo4j instance."


## Security considerations

- Use a restricted Neo4j user for exploration.
- Review the generated Cypher queries before executing them in production databases.
